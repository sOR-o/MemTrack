# Memory Management System

This is a simple simulation of memory management techniques like paging, segmentation, page fault handling, and page replacement algorithms (FIFO, LRU).

## Features
- Simulate memory allocation using pages and segments.
- Handle page faults and use FIFO and LRU page replacement algorithms.
- Track memory utilization over time.
- Visualize memory utilization using `matplotlib`.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
3. Install required libraries by running:
    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib
    ```
4. Run the simulation by executing:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Choose an Algorithm
When prompted, choose between FIFO or LRU for page replacement.

## Visualizations
The program will display a plot showing memory utilization over time based on the page accesses.
